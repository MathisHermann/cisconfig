# Cisconfigger
Tool to generate a Router (later maybe also Switch) config for IOS by Cisco. Based on laravel. It is deployed, you can ask for the URL.

Have fun.

You can change requests or make a PR if you want to contribute.

No guarantee that the config is correct. Check manually before inserting in router.

So long, and thanks for the fish. ðŸ«¡
